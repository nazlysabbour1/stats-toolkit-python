The package aims to provide handy code snippets for performing AB tests in python.
The tests included currently are following frequentist/classical approach but will be extended to include other simulation based approachs.

It uses libraries in python e.g. statsmodel, scipy.
There is also implementaion using base python functions for educational purposes.
